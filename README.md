# AI Session Cleaner

Keep local AI agent session data tidy across the CLIs you already use.

`ai-session-cleaner` is a terminal-first cleanup tool for multi-agent developers. It scans agent-specific session stores, shows exactly what would be removed, and lets you apply the same cleanup from one command.

Built for:

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
- [Opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)

Requires Node 18 or newer.

## Why use it

- One cleanup command across multiple AI coding CLIs
- Safe preview mode with `--safe-run`
- Sensible defaults: `45` days and all supported agents
- Human-readable tables for manual runs and `--json` for automation
- Agent-aware cleanup instead of generic file deletion

## Quick start

Run instantly with `npx`:

```bash
# preview everything older than 45 days across all supported tools
npx ai-session-cleaner --safe-run

# apply interactively
npx ai-session-cleaner

# apply without prompts
npx ai-session-cleaner --yes
```

## Examples

```bash
# preview everything with the default settings
npx ai-session-cleaner --safe-run

# clean only Claude Code and Codex sessions older than 30 days
npx ai-session-cleaner --agent claude-code,codex --older-than-days 30

# only match candidates with at least 1 MB of measurable reclaimable size
npx ai-session-cleaner --safe-run --larger-than 1MB

# ignore any project whose name or path contains "foo-bar"
npx ai-session-cleaner --safe-run --ignore-project foo-bar

# compact Codex SQLite databases after cleanup
npx ai-session-cleaner --agent codex --compact-sqlite --yes

# machine-readable output for scripts
npx ai-session-cleaner --safe-run --json

# disable orphaned project detection and only use age-based cleanup
npx ai-session-cleaner --safe-run --no-orphaned
```

## Local development

If you are working from this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start -- --safe-run
```

Or run directly with `tsx`:

```bash
npm run dev -- --safe-run
```

## What it cleans

The CLI focuses on cleanup that is both useful and safe to preview:

- sessions older than the configured age threshold
- orphaned session or project metadata whose original project root no longer exists

## Supported tools

| Tool | Agent id | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude-code` | `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.claude/session-env`, `~/.claude/tasks`, `~/.claude/file-history`, `~/.claude/todos`, `~/.claude/debug`, `~/.claude.json` |
| Codex | `codex` | `~/.codex/state_*.sqlite`, `~/.codex/logs_*.sqlite`, `~/.codex/history.jsonl`, `~/.codex/shell_snapshots` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `copilot` | `~/.copilot/session-state`, `~/.copilot/logs/session-*`, platform-specific VS Code globalStorage metadata |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini` | `~/.gemini/tmp`, `~/.gemini/history`, `~/.gemini/projects.json` |
| Opencode | `opencode` | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, `~/.local/share/opencode/storage`, `~/.local/share/opencode/snapshot` |

## Behavior

- `--older-than-days` defaults to `45`.
- Omitting `--agent` scans all supported tools: `claude-code`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, and `opencode`.
- `--agent` is the primary public flag. `--provider` is still supported as a compatibility alias.
- `--ignore-project` ignores matching project names or paths with a case-insensitive substring match. Repeat it to ignore multiple projects.
- `--larger-than` filters candidates by measurable reclaimable size, using values like `500KB`, `1MB`, or `2GiB`.
- `--compact-sqlite` is an opt-in apply-mode feature for Codex. It runs `VACUUM` after cleanup to reclaim SQLite file space.
- `--safe-run` is the recommended preview mode. `--dry-run` is still supported as an alias.
- Orphaned project detection is enabled by default. Use `--no-orphaned` if you only want age-based cleanup.

## Tooling

- `npm run format` formats the repository with Biome.
- `npm run lint` runs Biome checks.
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript type checking.
- `npm run clean` uses Node's built-in filesystem APIs and works across macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- `npm install` configures local git hooks for contributors in this repo.
- `pre-commit` formats and checks staged files with Biome.
- `pre-push` runs `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.

## Notes

- Claude orphaned-project cleanup also removes matching entries from `~/.claude.json`.
- Claude per-session debug logs in `~/.claude/debug/<session-id>.txt` are cleaned with the matching session.
- Codex cleanup uses `libsql` so local SQLite access still works on Node 18. It removes database rows, shell snapshots, and history entries. SQLite file sizes may not shrink immediately without a later `VACUUM`.
- Size filtering only applies to measurable reclaimable bytes. Metadata-only items and candidates whose reclaimable size cannot be estimated remain `0 B` and will not match a positive `--larger-than` threshold.
- Copilot metadata cleanup uses the platform-specific VS Code `globalStorage/github.copilot-chat` directory instead of assuming a macOS-only path.
- Copilot cleanup intentionally avoids deleting VS Code `workspaceStorage`, because that data is shared with other extensions.
- Gemini project roots are recovered from both `~/.gemini/tmp/*/.project_root` and `~/.gemini/history/*/.project_root`, then matched to hashed temp directories.
- Gemini orphaned-project cleanup also removes matching entries from `~/.gemini/projects.json`.
- Opencode cleanup removes matching SQLite rows from `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` plus mapped session/project files under `storage` and `snapshot`. SQLite file sizes may not shrink immediately without a later `VACUUM`.
- Some provider-owned files are intentionally skipped when they cannot be mapped safely to a previewable session or project candidate.
